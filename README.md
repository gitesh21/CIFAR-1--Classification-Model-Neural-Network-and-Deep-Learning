# CIFAR-1--Classification-Model-Neural-Network-and-Deep-Learning
## Aim
To implement a particular model in order to solve the CIFAR-10 classification problem and classify every single image in terms of 1 out of 10 classes.
To build a model on training set and evaluate on tetsing set to acheive highest possible accuracy
